## Usage

### Prepare your User Model
In your app's `User` model, include `Cubism::User` and set up a safelist of exposed attributes:

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Cubism::User
  self.cubicle_attributes = %i[email id]

  # ...
end
```

### Track Present Users in your Models
In the models you'd like to track presence for, include the `Cubism::Presence` concern:

```rb
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  include Cubism::Presence
end
```

### Set Up the Cubicle Template

Using the `cubicle_for` helper, you can set up a presence indicator. It will

1. subscribe to the respective resource, and
2. accept a "template" using the attributes safelisted above. Elements marked with `data-cubicle-attribute=` will have their `innerHTML` replaced by Cubism.

```erb
<%= cubicle_for @project do %>
  <span class="avatar">
    <span data-cubicle-attribute="email"></span>
  </span>
<% end %>
```

Note that this template will simply be repeated for every user that's in the `@project`s `present_users` set.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cubism'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

After `bundle`, install the Javascript library:

```bash
$ bin/yarn add @minthesize/cubism
```

### Kredis

This gem uses [kredis](https://github.com/rails/kredis) under the hood, so be sure to follow their [installation instructions](https://github.com/rails/kredis#installation). In other words, provide a Redis instance and configure it in `config/redis/shared.yml`.

### Javascript

In your app's Javascript entrypoint (e.g. `app/javascript/packs/application.js`) import and initialize `CableReady` (cubism will make use of the injected ActionCable consumer):

```js
import CableReady from "cable_ready";
import "@minthesize/cubism";

CableReady.initialize({ consumer });
```
